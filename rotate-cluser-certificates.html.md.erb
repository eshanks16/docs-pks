title: Rotating Certificates for Kubernetes Clusters
owner: TKGI

This topic describes how to rotate the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` 
CA certificates and their leaf certificates for Kubernetes clusters provisioned
by <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You must install the following:

* <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 or later
* Ops Manager v2.9 or later

## <a id="identify"></a>Retrieve the Cluster UUID

This section describes how to retrieve the universally unique identifier (UUID)
of a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.
You will use this UUID in [Access CredHub Maestro in the Ops Manager VM](#access)
and [Rotate the Certificates](#rotate) below.

To retrieve the UUID of a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes
cluster:

1. Log in to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. For instructions, see
[Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html).
1. To view the list of your deployed clusters, run `tkgi clusters`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ tkgi clusters

    Name    Plan Name       UUID                                    Status       Action  
    test    multi-master    ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f    succeeded    CREATE
    </pre>   

1. In the output of the `tkgi clusters` command,
locate your target cluster and record its UUID. If you want to rotate the `kubo_ca_2018`
and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates for multiple clusters,
locate all your target clusters in the output and record their UUIDs.
1. Proceed to [Access CredHub Maestro in the Ops Manager VM](#access) below.

## <a id="access"></a>Access CredHub Maestro in the Ops Manager VM

This section describes how to access the Maestro CLI in the Ops Manager VM,
identify your Kubernetes cluster deployments,
and then check certificate expiration dates using the Maestro CLI.

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM. For instructions, see
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh)
in the Ops Manager documentation.
1. Set the BOSH command line and CredHub environment variables on the
Ops Manager VM.
    1. To set the BOSH environment variables,
    follow the instructions in
    [Set the BOSH Environment Variables on the Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#export-bosh-envs)
    in the Ops Manager documentation.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ export BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager \
        BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=example_secret \
        BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
        BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.16.5 bosh
        </pre>

    1. To set the CredHub environment variables, export the following variables:
        * `CREDHUB_SERVER` is the URL of the BOSH Director CredHub server.
        This should be `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT:8844`.
        * `CREDHUB_CLIENT` is the name of the CredHub client.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CLIENT`.
        * `CREDHUB_SECRET` is the CredHub client secret.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
        * `CREDHUB_CA_CERT` is the path or value of the CredHub trusted CA certificate.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CA_CERT`.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        export CREDHUB_SERVER=10.0.16.5:8844 \
        CREDHUB_CLIENT=ops_manager \
        CREDHUB_SECRET=example_secret \
        CREDHUB_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
        </pre>

1. Identify the Kubernetes cluster deployments for which you want to rotate
the certificates:

    ```
    bosh deployments
    ```

    Kubernetes cluster deployment names begin with
    `service-instance_`. For example,
    `service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f`, where
    `ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f` is the cluster UUID you retrieved
    in [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.

1. To check certificate expiration dates for a
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster, run:
   
    ```
    maestro list --expires-within TIME-PERIOD --deployment-name service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID
    ```

    Where:
    * `TIME-PERIOD` is the time period for which you want to check the expiry
    window. Valid units are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months,
    and `y` for years. For example, `1y`.
    * `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID you retrieved in
    [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.

1. Proceed to [Rotate the Certificates](#rotate) below.

## <a id="rotate"></a>Rotate the Certificates

This section describes how to rotate the
`kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and their leaf certificates.
For each cluster you recorded in [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above,
complete the following procedure: 

1. Regenerate the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates:
 	
 	```
    maestro regenerate ca --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro regenerate ca --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID. You retrieved the UUID in
    [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.
 
1. Mark the latest version of each CA certificate as transitional:
    
    ```
    maestro update-transitional latest --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional latest --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the same cluster UUID as in the step above.

1. Redeploy the cluster: 
    
    1. Download the latest cluster deployment manifest:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
        ```

        Where:
        * `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID.
        * `PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST` is the location where you want to save
        the cluster deployment manifest. For example, `/tmp/manifest.yml`.

    1. Deploy the cluster:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
        ```

        Where:
        * `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID.
        * `PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST` is the location where you saved
        the cluster deployment manifest.

1. Mark the signing version of each CA certificate as transitional:
 
    ```
    maestro update-transitional signing --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional signing --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID.
    This command also removes the transitional flag from the latest version of the
    CA certificates.

1. Regenerate leaf certificates signed by `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018`:
    
    ```
    maestro regenerate leaf --signed-by /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro regenerate leaf --signed-by /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID.

1. Redeploy the cluster:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    ```

    See step 3 above for more information about `bosh manifest` and
    `bosh deploy`.

1. Remove the transitional flag:
	
    ```
    maestro update-transitional remove --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional remove --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID.

1. Redeploy the cluster:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    ```

    See step 3 above for more information about `bosh manifest` and
    `bosh deploy`.
